This was a fun project. The basis of the project was to interact with a server side API, specifically openWeather, and then create a dynamic webpage that included some specific attributes.

This project went pretty smooth when all things considered. The lesson prepared us for the project very well for the technical aspects and I think the bootcamp is doing an excellent job of building upon previous knowledge. 

One specific new strategy I took this time was I read the specifics of the project before I started the module lesson. I had the idea on the last project as I had to keep referring to the project code and try and parse out what I needed to build the application. This technique worked out wonderfully, as it gave me a couple days to mull over the problem while I completed the lessons and then annotated or made specific effort to remember a certain tactic to solve a problem.

I could have improved the code in a couple spots with a more rigourous use of objects and the fact that I could have chained fetch calls under one function but alas.
